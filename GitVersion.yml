# This GitVersion config allows a simple branching workflow
# all of which are versioned as alpha, with master and support/*
# getting promoted to beta for CI/CD piplines to release under.
# The final release is done via a tag, and can be a release candiate
# tag and/or the final release tag (the highest is selected).
